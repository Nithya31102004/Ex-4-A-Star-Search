<h1>ExpNo 4 : Implement A* search algorithm for a Graph</h1> 
<h3>Name:NITHYA T</h3>
<h3>Register Number:2305001023</h3>
<H3>Aim:</H3>
<p>To ImplementA * Search algorithm for a Graph using Python 3.</p>
<H3>Algorithm:</H3>


// A* Search Algorithm
1.  Initialize the open list
2.  Initialize the closed list
    put the starting node on the open 
    list (you can leave its f at zero)

3.  while the open list is not empty
    a) find the node with the least f on 
       the open list, call it "q"

    b) pop q off the open list
  
    c) generate q's 8 successors and set their 
       parents to q
   
    d) for each successor
        i) if successor is the goal, stop search
        
        ii) else, compute both g and h for successor
          successor.g = q.g + distance between 
                              successor and q
          successor.h = distance from goal to 
          successor (This can be done using many 
          ways, we will discuss three heuristics- 
          Manhattan, Diagonal and Euclidean 
          Heuristics)
          
          successor.f = successor.g + successor.h

        iii) if a node with the same position as 
            successor is in the OPEN list which has a 
           lower f than successor, skip this successor

        iV) if a node with the same position as 
            successor  is in the CLOSED list which has
            a lower f than successor, skip this successor
            otherwise, add  the node to the open list
     end (for loop)
  
    e) push q on the closed list
    end (while loop)

## PROGRAM
```python
import heapq
def a_star_search(graph, start, goal, heuristic):
open_set = []
heapq.heappush(open_set, (0 + heuristic[start], 0, start)) # (f_cost, g_cost, nod
came_from = {}
g_score = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
g_score[start] = 0
while open_set:
current_f_cost, current_g_cost, current_node = heapq.heappop(open_set)
if current_node == goal:
path = []
while current_node in came_from:
path.append(current_node)
current_node = came_from[current_node]
path.append(start)
path.reverse()
return path
for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
tentative_g_score = g_score[current_node] + weight
if tentative_g_score < g_score[neighbor]:
came_from[neighbor] = current_node
g_score[neighbor] = tentative_g_score
f_cost = tentative_g_score + heuristic[neighbor]
heapq.heappush(open_set, (f_cost, tentative_g_score, neighbor))
return None
graph = {}
num_nodes = int(input("Enter number of nodes in the graph: "))
print("\nEnter neighbors in the format: neighbor:weight (comma separated).")
print("Example: For node A â†’ B with cost 1 and C with cost 4, enter: B:1,C:4")
print("If no neighbors, press Enter.\n")
for _ in range(num_nodes):
node = input("Enter node name: ").strip()
neighbors = input(f"Enter neighbors for {node}: ").strip()
graph[node] = {}
if neighbors:
for edge in neighbors.split(","):
n, w = edge.split(":")
graph[node][n.strip()] = int(w.strip())
# Input heuristics
heuristic = {}
print("\nEnter heuristic values for each node:")
for node in graph:
h = int(input(f"Heuristic value for {node}: "))
heuristic[node] = h
# Start and goal
start_node = input("\nEnter the start node: ").strip()
goal_node = input("Enter the goal node: ").strip()
# Run A* Search
path = a_star_search(graph, start_node, goal_node, heuristic)
if path:
print(f"\nPath found: {path}")
else:
print("\nNo path found.")
